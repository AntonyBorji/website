    <p class="extra-info2">About me
        I started programming on the 20th Sep 2021, with a training company called "Code Nation". I chose this course (3 week Boot camp in Python, HTML & CSS), as I have been told in the past that programming & design would be something I'd be good at. I think people have said this, due to the fact I have always been resourceful & a quick learner, being able to take things apart and put them back together, or with my general ability at programming simple commands & designing complex Excel sheets with formulas built upon more formulas with several inputs.
        <br>
        Regarding the course & my final project to build a working website, I chose to build a quick reference guide for the video game “Sea of Thieves”, I wanted to do this, as I play it myself with several other people and noticed the lack of quick access information on the internet. There are a lot of good reference websites for the game, but they are full of too much description text & pointless jargon that players just don’t need to filter through, due to players normally only needing the information while playing, due to this being a MMO (Massive multiplayer online game), these games can not be paused, thus stopping a player from being able to move away from the game, knowing that they are safe. This means that time is an important factor within the game & shouldn’t be wasted, having to scroll through pagers of information. A clean-cut quick reference guide with a search bar for quick access, that leads to simple text, either explaining the location of a place (this being the most searched for item within the game)
        I hope you find this website insightful & helpful (it still is a work in progress)
